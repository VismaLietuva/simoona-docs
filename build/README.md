# Installation from Source Code

The contents of this folder is used to make building and starting Simoona easier. For this purposes we are using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) with a combination of [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/).

## Required Software

1. Internet Information Services (IIS) Server (<https://www.iis.net/>) - can be turned on as Windows feature
2. IIS URL Rewrite extension for IIS (<https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite>)
3. SQL Server Express (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express>)- Basic version should be enough

## Required Development Tools

1. NPM and Node.js (<https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>)
2. Yeoman (<http://yeoman.io>)
3. Bower (<https://bower.io>)
4. Git (<https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
5. Visual Studio 2015+ (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159>)

## Installation Instructions

Build script has two main operations:

* **do everything**: creates the database for you using SQL scripts, inserts organization name and connection string to Web.config file, resolves API and WebApp dependencies, builds them and after some more steps launches Simoona.
* **create database and resolve dependencies**: just creates and inserts necessary data to database, modifies Web.config file then resolves project's dependencies. Use latter option if you want to build and launch Simoona using different commands or environments.

1. Setting up environment for the very first time: 
    * Open command line
    * Navigate to `build\generator-simoona`
    * Enter `npm link`
1. Run `build.bat` as Administrator and follow the "wizard".
1. Enter organization name (you will need to login to the app).
1. Enter default user e-mail address. You will use this e-mail address to sign-in. It will create a user with `testerPass123` as a password.
1. Enter database connection string (example: `Data Source=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=60; MultipleActiveResultSets=True;`)
1. Enter dabase name (example: `SimoonaDB`)
1. Wait for build script to finish.

## Installation Troubleshooting

1. build\build.ps1 cannot be loaded. The file build\build.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

    Option a)

    * Select option in build script 'Select powershell build script ExecutionPolicy' -> Bypass

    Option b)

    * Right-click on build.ps1
    * Click on Properties
    * Check Unblock checkbox
    * Apply changes and click OK

1. build.bat hangs on "Preparing to run build script..."

    * Inspect your NuGet package sources. One way of doing that is by running "nuget sources" command
    * Disable NuGet package sources that require authentication. Ideally, you should enable only nuget.org as a source
    * Run build.bat as administrator
    * Enable the disabled packages after installation is complete
